A finite state machine implementation using enums for states and events. This simple approach allows for a highly readable state machine, while still supporting features including guards, transition callbacks and logging.

## Features

Supported state machine features:

- States and events represented by enums
- Optional callbacks on state entry, exit and transitions
- Optional guard functions on state transitions
- `fire()` returns `bool` indicating if transition was allowed
- Pluggable logging via `StateMachineLogger` interface
- Stream of transition events

## Usage

To get started create an instance of `StateMachine<S, E>` with the initial state and a map of transitions between states. The map of transitions should be a map of state enums to a list of valid `Transition` from that state.

When declaring an instance of `StateMachine` (or `FSM`), the type of the state and event enums must be explicitly specified in the generic type arguments (i.e. `StateMachine<State, Event>`). Failing to do so will reduce the compilers ability to validate the use of the state and event enums at compile time.

Then call `fire` on the `StateMachine` instance to transition to the next state.

```dart
import 'package:small_fsm/small_fsm.dart';

enum State { water, ice, steam }
enum Event { heat, cool }

final fsm = StateMachine<State, Event>(
  initialState: State.water,
  transitions: {
    State.water: [
      Transition(State.ice, Event.cool),
      Transition(State.steam, Event.heat),
    ],
    State.ice: [
      Transition(State.steam, Event.heat, guard: () => temp > 100),
      Transition(State.water, Event.heat),
    ],
    State.steam: [
      Transition(State.water, Event.cool, onTransition: () => print('Liquefied')),
    ],
  },
  onEnter: {
    State.steam: () => print('The water is boiling'),
  },
  onExit: {
    State.steam: () => print('The water has stopped boiling'),
  },
);

final success = fsm.fire(Event.cool);
print('Transition allowed: $success');
```

State transition events can also be listened to using the `onTransition` stream.

```dart
fsm.onTransition.listen((event) {
  print('State transitioned from ${event.previousState} to ${event.newState} on ${event.event}');
});
```

## Logging

To add logging to your state machine, implement the `StateMachineLogger` interface or use the built-in `PrintLogger`.

```dart
// Built-in console logger
final fsm = StateMachine<State, Event>(
  logger: const PrintLogger(),
  // ...
);

// Custom logger implementation
class MyLogger implements StateMachineLogger {
  @override
  void logTransition(String event, String fromState, String toState) {
    // Your logging logic here
  }
}
```

## Type aliasing

To reduce the verbosity of the code, the following type aliases are provided:

```dart
typedef FSM<State extends Enum, Event extends Enum> = StateMachine<State, Event>;
typedef Tx<State extends Enum, Event extends Enum> = Transition<State, Event>;
```

This will allow you to write the following:

```dart
final fsm = FSM<State, Event>(
  initialState: State.water,
  transitions: const {
    State.water: [
      Tx(State.ice, Event.cool),
      Tx(State.steam, Event.heat),
    ],
    State.ice: [
      Tx(State.water, Event.heat),
    ],
  },
);
```
